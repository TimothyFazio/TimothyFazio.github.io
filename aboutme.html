    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Timothy Fazio and I am a student at the University of Rhode Island. I'm curretly taking CSC 106 which is teaching me how to make this website and my other projects.
        I plan on getting my bachelor's degree in computer science and my masters in cyber security.
<br><br>
One of my favorite activities to to play video games and they somewhat inspired me to persue a path in computer science. I have always be interested in how games work and if I could ever make one myself.
Other than video games, I play precussion and the piano. I have been playing both for years and I really enjoy them. I also have many animals that I really love with my favorite being my cat Mitzy (show below).
