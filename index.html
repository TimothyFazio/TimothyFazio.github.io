    <h1>Welcome to Tim's Programing Portfolio</h1>
    This website is my digital portfolio where I will talk about myself and my coding projects, this website being on of them. 
        I made this website by using HTML and CSS. 
        This website has all of the programs that I have coded over the corse of my CSC 106 The Joy of Programming course at the University of Rhode Island. <br><br>
